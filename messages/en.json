    "product_oak":"Oak wood has a high strength coefficient and is practically unaffected by time. The density of Oak wood is 700 kg/m3, and this high value is of great importance. The denser the wood, the harder and heavier it is, making it more difficult for processing and technical drying. These factors make the processing of Oak boards more challenging, but they also offer tremendous advantages - the resulting products, such as stairs, railings, flooring, and others, are significantly less prone to wear and tear, which characterizes Oak wood as long-lasting.",
    "product_ash":"Ash is a beautiful and noble finishing material. Due to its pronounced annual rings, the texture features extraordinary and interesting patterns with a rich range of shades. The beauty of this wood is especially relevant for interior decoration. Different board sections are used to solve complex tasks in furniture and other industries. Therefore, dry 30mm thick ash boards will serve as an excellent material both technically and aesthetically for finishing kitchen facades, bedroom furniture, components of tables and chairs, decorative panels, and paneling.",
    "product_modrina":"Larch, due to its exceptional natural structure, has a high level of strength that puts it in a high position among the most durable wood species. The density of larch wood, which reaches 800 kg/m³, is impressive for its enormous density. Products made of larch are worth appreciating as works of art that are resistant to the tests of time. From stairs and flooring to furniture and joinery, larch proves to be a reliable material that justifies its heavy processing with an unsurpassed, durable result. The strength of larch makes it an ideal choice for the production of objects that have to withstand stress and wear over a long period of time.",
    "product_birch":"Birch wood is an ideal material with numerous advantages. Its attractive natural beauty and unique texture give it a special charm, while its strength and durability ensure a long service life for products. Its ease of processing allows for creating various furniture and decorative items. Moreover, birch wood is an environmentally friendly and renewable resource, making it an attractive choice for sustainable construction and design. Thanks to all these advantages, it remains a popular material in various creative and practical fields.",
    "manufacturing_process_01":"In the manufacturing process, we use modern equipment, advanced wood processing technologies, and quality control.
